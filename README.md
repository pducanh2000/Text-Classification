# Predicting-Effective-Arguments
This is my solution for a Kaggle competition - [Feedback Prize - Predicting Effective Arguments](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/feedback-prize-effectiveness/).

The goal of this competition is to classify argumentative elements in student writing as "effective," "adequate," or "ineffective."
